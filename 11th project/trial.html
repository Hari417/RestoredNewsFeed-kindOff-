At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software for $500: a game he created called Blastar. In one telling incident at that time, Musk, along with his brother, planned to open a video game arcade near their school. Ultimately, their parents nixed the plan.</font></p>

                <p class="body1sub1p2s1"><font face="Times" >But apparently, the only thing stopping them was the need for a city permit that had to beapplied for by an adult. Musk’s intellectual aptitude did him few favors as a child. He found few friends on his school days. "I had a terrible upbringing. I had a lot of adversity growing up. One thing I worry about with my kids is they don't face enough adversity," he would later say in an interview.</font></p>
